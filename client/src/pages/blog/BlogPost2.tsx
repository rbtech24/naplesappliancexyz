                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Common Causes:</strong> Dirty condenser coils (accelerated by dust and humidity), blocked air vents, worn door seals allowing humid air infiltration, and overworked compressors during summer months.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Warning Signs:</strong> Food spoiling faster than usual, ice cream soft in freezer, condensation inside refrigerator, or unusual humming sounds.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Prevention:</strong> Clean condenser coils every 2 months instead of the manufacturer's recommended 6 months. Check door seals monthly for cracks or buildup that prevents proper sealing. Keep vents clear and avoid overloading the refrigerator, especially during hot summer months.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>DIY Solutions:</strong> Clean coils with a coil brush and vacuum, ensure proper airflow around the unit, and check that the temperature settings haven't been accidentally changed. If problems persist after basic maintenance, professional diagnosis is needed.

                    Washing Machine Won't Drain

                  <CardDescription>
                    Particularly common due to Southwest Florida's hard water and humidity

                <CardContent>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Common Causes:</strong> Lint and mineral deposits clogging drain hoses, soap scum buildup from high humidity, foreign objects in the pump, or kinked drain hoses.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Warning Signs:</strong> Standing water in the drum after cycles, clothes coming out soaking wet, gurgling sounds during drain cycle, or error codes related to drainage.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Prevention:</strong> Use appropriate amounts of high-efficiency detergent, clean the lint filter after every load (not just dryers need this!), and run a monthly cleaning cycle with washing machine cleaner to remove mineral and soap buildup.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>DIY Solutions:</strong> Check for kinked hoses, clean the drain pump filter if accessible, and ensure the drain hose isn't pushed too far into the standpipe. For persistent issues, professional cleaning of internal components may be necessary.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Common Causes:</strong> Clogged dryer vents (critical in humid climates), worn door seals allowing humid air infiltration, failing heating elements, or lint buildup in internal ducts.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Warning Signs:</strong> Clothes still damp after normal cycles, excessive heat in laundry room, burning smell, or the dryer exterior becoming extremely hot.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Prevention:</strong> Clean lint screen after every load, professional vent cleaning every 3 months in humid climates (vs. annual in dry climates), and ensure exterior vent flap opens properly when dryer operates.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>DIY Solutions:</strong> Check and clean the lint screen, inspect the external vent for obstructions, and ensure proper airflow. However, internal duct cleaning and heating element testing require professional service.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Warning Signs:</strong> White spots on glassware, cloudy dishes even when clean, gritty feeling on supposedly clean dishes, or poor cleaning performance despite proper loading.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Prevention:</strong> Use rinse aid appropriate for hard water areas, clean dishwasher filter monthly, and consider a water softening system for the entire home to protect all appliances.

                  <p>
                    <strong>DIY Solutions:</strong> Run empty cycles with dishwasher cleaner monthly, check and clean spray arms for mineral clogs, and adjust detergent amounts based on water hardness. Professional descaling may be needed for severe buildup.

                    <strong>Common Causes:</strong> Sediment accumulation from hard water, corroded anode rods in humid conditions, mineral deposits on heating elements, or insulation degradation from humidity exposure.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Warning Signs:</strong> Longer time to heat water, unusual noises during heating cycles, discolored or smelly hot water, or significantly higher energy bills without increased usage.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Prevention:</strong> Annual tank flushing to remove sediment, anode rod inspection every 2 years (vs. 3-4 years in drier climates), and temperature setting maintenance to prevent overwork.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>DIY Solutions:</strong> Check temperature settings, inspect for visible leaks, and listen for unusual sounds. Tank flushing, anode rod replacement, and heating element service require professional expertise due to safety considerations.

            <p>
              While many of these issues can be prevented with proper maintenance, knowing when to attempt DIY solutions versus calling professionals is crucial for safety and cost-effectiveness. In Southwest Florida's challenging environment, professional diagnosis often reveals multiple contributing factors that aren't apparent to untrained observers.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion: Prevention is Your Best Strategy</h2>
            
            <p>
              Most of these common problems can be prevented or significantly delayed with proper maintenance tailored to Southwest Florida's unique climate challenges. Regular professional inspections, combined with homeowner vigilance, create the best defense against costly appliance failures.
            </p>

            <p>
              Remember that our humid, salt-air environment accelerates normal wear patterns, making proactive maintenance even more critical than in other regions. When problems do arise, early intervention often means the difference between a simple repair and complete appliance replacement.
            </p>

            <p>
              Don't wait until appliances fail completely. At the first sign of any of these common issues, address them promptly to minimize repair costs and extend appliance lifespan. Your wallet and your comfort will thank you, especially during Southwest Florida's demanding summer months.
