                  <p className="text-red-700 text-sm">
                    Naples regularly experiences temperatures exceeding 95°F with heat indices reaching 110°F+ during summer months. Your refrigerator wasn't designed for these extreme conditions, making specialized care essential for optimal performance.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-6">The Science Behind Heat's Impact on Refrigeration</h2>

            <p>
              Refrigerators operate on a simple principle: they remove heat from inside the unit and expel it to the surrounding environment. When ambient temperatures rise significantly, this heat transfer process becomes exponentially more difficult. Your refrigerator's compressor must work harder and longer to achieve the same cooling effect, creating a cascade of problems that can lead to premature failure.
            </p>

            <p>
              The physics are straightforward but unforgiving. For every 10°F increase in ambient temperature, your refrigerator's energy consumption can increase by 15-25%. In Naples, where kitchen temperatures can reach 85°F during summer afternoons, your refrigerator is fighting an uphill battle that stresses every component from the compressor to the condenser coils.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Understanding the Heat Transfer Challenge</h3>

            <p>
              Modern refrigerators are designed with optimal performance at ambient temperatures between 60-80°F. When your kitchen temperature climbs above 85°F—common in Naples homes without adequate air conditioning—several critical issues emerge:
            </p>

            <p>
              The condenser coils, typically located at the back or bottom of your refrigerator, must dissipate heat to the surrounding air. When that air is already hot and humid, the heat exchange becomes inefficient. This forces the compressor to run longer cycles, generating even more heat and creating a vicious cycle that can lead to system failure.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, the temperature differential between the refrigerator's interior and the ambient environment decreases, making it harder to maintain consistent internal temperatures. This explains why your ice cream might be softer or your milk spoils faster during particularly hot Naples summers.
            </p>
